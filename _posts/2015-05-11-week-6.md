This week we made extensive progress on PCB design and are on track to ordering our V 0.1 boards this week. 

Our system is currently working 100% on our bread board. Data is captured and written and when requested it is sent over bluetooth to the processing host.

Our android app is now bluetooth enabled and is able to receive and store data over bluetooth.

Our battery and SPI Flash Memory are currently in the mail from some kind of delay but should arrive tomorrow.

Goals for the next week.

* Extensive data collection and analysis.
* App user experience
* Several battery run down tests
* V 0.1 enclosure design
* Improve PCB layout for V 0.2
