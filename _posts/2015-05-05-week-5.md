This week we have our gyroscope and sd card module communicating with the gyroscope writing data to a file when requested. Using this system we have sampled data for a single rotation and a double rotation and have analyzed this data. Analyzed dividing by the sensitivity of the gyroscope and summing the data over the rotation time. 

One rotation: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiAnG2Gn59UOZ7D8OjPxPa9_1eEixUD_lgkqTyPQ_VY/edit?usp=sharing 

Two rotations: https://docs.google.com/a/uw.edu/spreadsheets/d/1nw0aA4pslrW62eJlLkfWRO8EjXlTTh-SGJcXaTR1yn4/edit?usp=sharing 

On our android application we have buttons and views working, we are building from the ground up. 


Goals for the next week:
* Create PCB design
* Have android saving bluetooth data
* Create a model for determining a spin count
* Do LiPo Battery test
