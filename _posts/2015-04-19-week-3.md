This week we ordered our parts and read several tutorials involving hooking up multiple peripherals to our microcontroller. 

We collected pinout information, datasheets, and tutorials into this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Beo0UD5Y9ffbZlnI5H8CANSwm-pplwlOWwIBRRgTXoA/edit?usp=sharing

Here is a basic dataflow diagram for our device:
