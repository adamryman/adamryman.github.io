## What does it do?

SpinBit is a lightweight clip on device to record your spins over time when dancing and/or preforming, when you cannot have your phone on your person. It allows you to track your spin for improvement over time or to share with your friends. 

###Motivation
Many performance arts include spinning as a common motion. Just as a walker may want to track their steps throughout the day, many performers would like to track their spins for practice, performance, and bragging rights.

###Product
The SpinBit will be a small device that can be clipped to the waist to track when the user completes a rotation in a certain time frame. The device connects to a phone via bluetooth where the data is stored, timestamped, and possibly shared.

###Hardware
A gyroscope will be used to track the users rotation, and a bluetooth module will send data from the sensor to the users phone.

###Software
The mobile application will be used to log incoming data from the wearable device, graph this data over time, change device settings, and share data with other users.
