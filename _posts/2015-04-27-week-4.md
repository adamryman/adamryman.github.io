At the end of last week we received our shipment of parts. This meant that we could start the process of putting everything together.

We began by hooking the bluetooth module up to an Arduino. We were able to connect to the bluetooth module with a computer and send a message from the Arduino back to the computer. We also started to hook up gyroscope. The pins need to be soldered to the gyroscope board in order for it to work well (this should happen tomorrow), but we were able to get readings from the gyroscope and view them on the Arduino console.

The android app was started this past week.
